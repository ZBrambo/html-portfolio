<h1>The Greatest Pieces of Film according to Zach</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies List</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</h3>
<p> While this movie is an amazing multiverse movie that does the genre justice, the film is also an amazing family story and the connections we make through love for one another.</p>

<h3>Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>With Spider-Man being my favorite, a Spider-Man movie being on the list was no question. Though I chose "Across the Spider-Verse" as it delves more into Miles story and expanding the Spider-Man universe.</p>

<h3>The Thing</h3>
<p>I'm a huge fan of horror, sci-fi, and mystery movies. "The Thing" by John Carpenter is a perfect bundle of all three of these genres</p>
